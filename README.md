# Vanilla Javascript Simple Bookshelf Web Application

#### Written by : [samuelms21](https://github.com/samuelms21)
### Brief Description
A simple bookshelf / library web app I made for a web development certification given by [Dicoding](https://dicoding.com), an Indonesian ed-tech company. The company focuses on educating digital literacy and teaches digital skills. Most of them are about programming, web technologies and specific certifications that will lead to tech job roles (e.g. Machine Learning Engineer, Front-End Developer, etc.).

I used **localStorage** from the **Web Storage API** available in most today's browsers to save and retrieve data.

Desgined and developed the UI using plain CSS, no frameworks or libraries (they don't allow it).
